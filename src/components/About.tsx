            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              I&apos;m a fourth-year Computer Science student at Ontario Tech University with a broad and practical skill set in software development, QA, and IT systems. I&apos;ve built full-stack web apps, mobile applications, and backend systems using tools like Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, and Flutter. I&apos;m also experienced in frontend development, RESTful APIs, and database design.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
              In addition to software, I&apos;ve worked on projects involving software testing, file-based I/O, and Bash scripting. My academic experience includes systems programming in C and basic exposure to computer architecture and low-level logic, which gives me a strong foundation for embedded or hardware-adjacent development.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
              I&apos;m currently interning as an IT Support Intern at a financial firm in Jeddah, where I&apos;ve been gaining hands-on experience with Windows systems, hardware setup, user support, and enterprise infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
              I&apos;m adaptable, collaborative, and eager to contribute across a range of roles, from frontend, backend, mobile, and QA/testing, to IT support or data-oriented work. I&apos;m always looking to grow and apply my skills in meaningful, real-world projects.
